							<p>“It scared the crap out of me. I thought, ‘this is possible...very possible’.”</p>
							<p>“It was almost educational.”</p>
							<p>“It was probably an A+ on the realistic scale.”</p>

							<p>These are just some of the sentiments moviegoers had upon leaving the theater in 2015 after watching the multi-million dollar disaster flick, “San Andreas.” In the film, rescue pilot Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson deftly maneuvers through the crumbling California mayhem of three super-earthquakes and a gargantuan tsunami as they destroy the coastline from Los Angeles to San Francisco. </p>

							<p>Now clearly, this film is a cacophonous catastrophe ripe with top-notch CGI and a by-the-book plot, so an average gut response to these reactions is, “it’s Hollywood, there’s no way that this is real.” But as many disaster movies do, the premise preys upon a bludgeoning cultural tension. This time, it’s The Big One — the belief that the West Coast is soon to be rattled by an earthquake of epic proportions. This falls in the same category as “2012” mining the Mayan Calendar-predicted doomsday for its plot and “The Day After Tomorrow” coming hot off the heels of the concern surrounding for melting ice caps and greenhouse gas. Soon there will be “Geostorm,” a film about how technology to prevent such climate change inversely destroys the planet. These movies allow audiences to experience their wildest anxieties and gain exposure to severe scenarios without the actual presence of a threat. In doing this, these movies have the potential to subliminally teach what to do or expect if one of these disasters were to happen.</p>

							<p>For those in landlocked areas or even coastal cities outside of tsunami-zones, tidal waves are not a typical concern. The last deadly tsunami to claim a life in the United States was in Crescent City, Calif. in 2013, where a man was swept out to sea and presumed dead after arriving to take photos of the incoming waves. In comparison to the fatalities of hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, blizzards and wildfires that have have ravaged America in recent years, tidal waves fail to be on the forefront of many Americans’ minds. </p>

							<p>As a result, films such as these serve as the only contextualization available to audiences for such a rare event, making their depiction all the more impactful. </p>

							<p>In 2011, the 9.1 magnitude Tōhoku underwater earthquake rattled Japan, unearthing a tsunami that devastated more than one million buildings. Civilians were warned that the wave had an estimated arrival time of 30 minutes in areas first affected, and about an hour for cities farther out. Reports indicate that even with the warnings, the predominant cause of the death for many was misjudging the elevation they thought to be safe. </p>

							<p>In footage from Youtube, those escaping fail to realize just how quick the stunted flow of water is and how powerfully it surges upwards. In aerial shots, the water moves slowly like magma. The waves don’t have the same gumption many have come to expect from Hollywood’s portrayals, where the water crashes above and around buildings, spurting out the tops of structures like oil geysers and gushing out alleyways. In contrast, the authentic footage of tsunamis fails to instill the same fear that the manmade mammoth Warner Bros waves do. </p>

							<p>Thus, two styles wash ashore: the realistic tsunami depictions and the misleading havoc of big-budget CGI. Movies like “Hereafter” (2010) and “The Impossible” (2012) and feature a more grounded wave, while “Perfect Storm” (2000), “The Day After Tomorrow” (2004), “2012” (2009), and  “San Andreas” (2015) surf the line of absurdity. Yet, these skyscraper style waves are not physically impossible. In fact, they have happened before, such as in 1958 Alaska when a wave reached heights higher than the Empire State Building. Known as megatsunamis, films such as “Deep Impact (1998)”  and “The Wave” (2015) feature this type of disaster. </p>

							<p>To clear the water, what is the difference between a tsunami and a megatsunami?</p>

							<p>A tsunami is the byproduct of an earthquake, where a series of ever increasing gushes of seawater can travel to shore at speeds up to 100 miles per hour and inwards of about a 1000 feet, churning whole cities into debris in its wake. A megatsunami is a large, singular  displacement of water, usually from a landslide or asteroid, that can reach extreme heights, ranging from 300-1000 feet high.  </p>

							<p>To put these waves in comparison, picture a bathtub. A tsunami would be the equivalent of making a jerky movement inside the tub that causes the water to quickly spill over. A megatsunami would be as if you instead cannonballed into the tub and all the water came splashing out.</p>

							<p>For the deadliest tsunami in recorded history, the wall of water was no more than 50 feet high in certain areas. On December 26, 2004, a 9 magnitude earthquake struck off the island of Sumatra and unleashed a set of waves that would claim or displace more than 300,000 lives. The lack of knowledge regarding tsunamis is one of the primary factors of their deadliness. Before the first wave hits, which usually is the smallest and least threatening, the tide will recede unusually rapidly. The phenomenon of the noticeable fall in water that December day attracted spectators who would later be unable to outrun the waves. Tsunami experts have stated that this sign may give those endangered five minutes warning time — enough time to reach higher ground.

								<p>In bringing the natural disaster to the big screen, “The Impossible” took the nearly impossible task of depicting one of the world’s deadliest natural disasters in an appropriate fashion.  Starring Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor and Tom Holland, this film follows the real life Belón family vacationing in south Sri Lanka for the holidays. On Boxing Day, the infamous tsunami decimates their resort and tears the family apart in the process. The story examines the aftermath, where the father and two sons search frantically for their missing mother and brother.</p>

								<p>In the film, the wave peaks up just above the heights of the trees rumbling like a jet plane, its crest a nightmarish sludge. Within seconds, Lucas (Holland) dives into the pool, only to be sucked back into the wake. As the film cuts back, Maria (Watts) is caught in the current, damaged, displaced and delirious. When she realizes her son is still alive, a harrowing 9-minute sequence follows with Watts and Holland desperately flailing and clinging towards one another, the avalanche of rubble and seawater blinding them. For tsunamis, the majority of deaths that occur are not from the impact of the break or drowning once pulled back to the open sea. Instead, it is being mangled in with the debris and failing to free oneself. By placing the audience in the water, submerged and adrenaline-ladened, the director allows us to begin to realize the unique horror of the tsunami’s merciless force. </p>

									<p>While the film garnered criticism for using the story of a Spanish family and casting them with white actors, focusing on an anglo-centric narrative over the 300,000 local lives that were lost, it does deliver the most accurate and disturbing depiction of a tsunami yet on screen. It has received praise from survivors of the disaster, scientists and critics alike.</p>

									<p>The most recent movie to receive this sort of praise comes not from standard tsunami fare, but a foreign film that falls in the megatsunami category. Norway’s first major foray into the blockbuster game was their take on the nation’s landslide prone countryside in “The Wave” (2015). In the small Nordic town of Geiranger, a geologist named Kirstian Eikjord and his family are set to move before Kristian recognizes the mountains above the city are set to fall. When the landslide does give way, it results in a cataclysmic 250-foot tall surge of water, crashing down and killing those not yet evacuated.</p>

						<p>Events such as this have happened before, and for those in that area, serve as a reminder of the unfortunate reality a landslide could cause. In 1934 Tafjord, Finland, a rockslide created a wave that reached 200 feet and killed 40. In 1936 Italy at the Vajont Dam, engineers misjudged the force of an impending rockslide and when it did hit, the 250-foot wave overtopped the structure, destroying five villages and killing nearly 2000 people. Still, the largest wave on record comes from Lituya Bay Alaska, where an earthquake sent a mountain crumbling into the water, hoisting water up to 1,710 feet high and stripping trees and soil down to bedrock in the process. To say that waves can never reach that height while arguing against the realism in disaster movies is wrong. How the water rose that high is another question and something an earthquake can’t do.</p>


						<p>While films have no moral obligation to function as public service announcements informing what to do or not do in any situation, they do paint a picture of the world in a dramatic fashion. When a film tries not to build a new world and instead inhabit the present one, it’s the simple fallacies that both detract from the reality while presenting subtle 'could be true’ normalities. </p>

						<p>For “San Andreas,” scientists panned the film on a variety of fronts, with a heavy discussion about the tsunami that climaxes in the third act. Emerging off the coast of San Francisco, the giant wave rises to heights greater than the Golden Gate bridge. Reminiscent of “The Perfect Storm” (2000), boats race the water to escape the break before it comes crashing down the other side. While The Rock narrowly evades death, the rest of the city is not so fortunate, especially those in the path of a rogue cruise ship.</p>

						<p>So to answer the question “could a wave like that actually happen?” — in that setting, it could not. The first wave is not always the largest, tsunamis fail to form a plunging breaker of that magnitude in such shallow water and the San Andreas fault slides horizontally and would fail to create enough vertical motion. </p>

						<p>However, will movies like this continue to happen?</p>

						<p>When the box office sales reach as high as the waves designed in their films, the flood of these movies shows no sign of stopping. It’s up to us, however, to delineate fact from fiction. </p>
